# BitBurner
My collection of simple, BitBurner scripts<br>

These were writtin in Netscript 2.0, Netscript is a subset of JavaScript, with some additional functions added in to allow interaction with the game.

I make sure to have very simple and easy to understand code, I do try to have low ram usage but no promises

I hope these are usefull, enjoy.
